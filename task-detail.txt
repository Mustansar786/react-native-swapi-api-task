  ========********************** Project Architecture ********************==========


  All the main code in in /src/ folder. inside the souce folder, i created many folders 
  to show you the code pattern that i followed. 

  => Fist Folder is /api/ . Inside that folder i make the global and one time use of
  axios file. i didn't call axios again and again in project. i set the base url and
  endpoints of our task.

  => Second Folder is /assets/. Inside this folder, i put the task images files, icons
  files and fonts files. i just created this folder to show you that i am following this 
  achitecture.

  => Third Folder is /globals/. Inside this folder, i put the constants variables and used 
  for images path, font setup and theme color setup.

  => Fouth Folder is /hooks/. Inside this folder i created some global hooks that we can use in
  our whole project. such as useDebounce, useFetch, useAppOpening, useFirstTimeAppOpen etc.

  => Fifth Folder is /stores/. Inside this folder, i set the all redux, like  all actions, all 
  reducers, rootReducer and store.

  => Sixth Folder is /types/. Inside this folder i managed the types of some components. I am 
  using the same techniques in other clients projects.

  => Seventh Folder is /utils/. Inside this folder, we can manage push notification, global error,
  async storage, permissions and many more global method. I just creat this folder to show you 
  the architecture.

  => Eighth Folder is /View/. This is our main folder. This folder we are using for UI of the app.
  I create 3 more different folder inside this /View/ folder.

        -> first folder is /components/. In this folder we can make the reuseable components and 
        some main seperate components.

        ->second folder is /nagigation/. Inside this folder i setup all the navigation.

        -> third folder is /screens/. Indside this folder we can make our main screen components
        and child screens component that we have to pass to navigation. We can make seperate folder
        of each main screen and inside that folder we have to create the child screens components 
        and screen.

This is the architecture and coding pattern that i followed.

Thank you!
